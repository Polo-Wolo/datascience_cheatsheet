SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector-based graphics format used for creating and displaying images on the web. Unlike raster graphics formats like JPEG and PNG, SVG images are defined using mathematical equations and can be scaled up or down without losing resolution or clarity. This makes SVG a highly versatile and efficient format for displaying graphics on the web, particularly for graphics that need to be displayed at different sizes or resolutions. SVG files are created using vector graphics software, and can be edited and manipulated using code or graphic design tools. SVG also supports interactivity and animation, allowing developers to create engaging and interactive web experiences using graphics and animations.

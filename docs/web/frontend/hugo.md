# Hugo

Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator that allows developers to create fast and secure websites. Hugo is built using the Go programming language and uses a simple folder structure and Markdown files to create content. The framework allows developers to create custom themes or use pre-built themes to create responsive and customizable websites. Hugo is known for its fast build times and ability to handle large websites with ease. It also includes a built-in web server and live reload functionality, which allows developers to preview changes in real-time. Hugo has become a popular choice for developers who want to create fast, secure, and easy-to-maintain static websites without the complexity of a traditional CMS.

# Pytorch

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library used for building and training neural networks. It is developed and maintained by Facebook's AI Research lab. PyTorch is designed to be flexible and efficient, with a focus on dynamic computational graphs that allow for efficient computation of gradients during model training.

PyTorch provides a variety of tools for building and training neural networks, including pre-built modules for common network layers, loss functions, and optimizers. It also allows for easy integration with other Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation in addition to machine learning.

One of the unique features of PyTorch is its use of tensors as the fundamental data structure for computations, which makes it easy to perform mathematical operations on multi-dimensional arrays. PyTorch also provides tools for deploying trained models to production, including support for popular deployment platforms such as ONNX and TensorFlow. Overall, PyTorch is a popular choice for deep learning projects due to its flexibility, ease of use, and powerful capabilities.

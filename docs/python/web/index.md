## Which Framework to use ?

There are several web frameworks available for developing web applications using Python, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of a framework depends on various factors, such as the project requirements, your experience level, and personal preferences. Here are some popular frameworks you can consider:

* Django: Django is a high-level, batteries-included web framework for Python. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and provides a robust set of features, including an ORM, templating engine, admin interface, and user authentication. Django is ideal for developing complex web applications with a lot of built-in functionality.
* Flask: Flask is a lightweight web framework that is easy to learn and use. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and provides basic functionality for building web applications, such as routing, templating, and request handling. Flask is ideal for building simple web applications or prototypes quickly.
* Pyramid: Pyramid is a flexible, open-source web framework that is easy to use and has a modular architecture. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and provides features such as URL routing, templating, and user authentication. Pyramid is ideal for building web applications that require scalability and flexibility.
* Bottle: Bottle is a lightweight web framework that is easy to learn and use. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and provides basic functionality for building web applications, such as routing, templating, and request handling. Bottle is ideal for building small to medium-sized web applications quickly.
